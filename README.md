### Download every generated time utterance from the new Matrix pre-trailer(?) !

Uses ffmpeg to cut out part where time utterance is located and convert to oga. Cause I want my voice clock to have Morpheus voice!

Here's more about how I generated urls for each timestamp (in russian): https://t.me/cabchat/205

Usage:
1. Install ffmpeg
0. `./query.sh`
